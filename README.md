# "Hacker Hot Sauce"

My own recipe for habanero-lime-gochujang hot sauce, made by hackers, for hackers ... and anyone else who loves rich bright hot sauces.

I fell in love with gochujang sauce the first time I had bibimbap. In the summer of 2015, with special help from my very patient, Korean-born co-worker, Kyonghee Moon, I decided to try making my own gochujang sauce.  While I loved the basic flavor, I wanted more heat and more brightness.  I turned to my old friends the habanero chili pepper and the lime, and after four or five batches adjusting the balance, with my hot sauce co-conspirator Rosa, I was happy with the result and finally wrote down the recipe.

Kyonghee recommends putting this on barbebcued meats; I love it on everything from eggs to veggies to hot dogs.


# Ingredients

* 3 cups soy sauce
* 2 cups vinegar
* 1/2 cup lime juice
* 1/2 cup molasses
* 25 cloves of fresh(!) garlic, minced.  Substitute 10 Tbsp of pre-minced garlic from a jar ("jarlic") if that's all you have, but fresh garlic makes a surprisingly big difference.
* 2 cups white sugar
* 2 cups brown sugar
* 1 tsp citric acid
* 3 Kg (6.6lb, one large box) of gochujang paste, spicy.  I recommend "CJ Haechandle" brand, "Level 4: Very Hot".
* 1 cup sesame oil
* 5-10 habanero peppers, depending on how hot the ones you have are, and on your personal heat preferences.  I usually use about 8 fresh ones.  They're added at the end, to taste, and they're usually quite inexpensive, so I'd recommend erring on the side of getting more than you think you'll want.
* entirely optional: banana


# Equipment
* 8-quart or larger stock pot or other large pot; larger is easier to mix in 
* disposable gloves
* safety goggles
* containers for hot sauce, e.g. squeeze bottles
* funnel
* ventilation


# Directions

1. Mix the soy sauce, vinegar, lime juice, and molasses in a stockpot or other large pot on the stove over low heat.
2. Scoop out about one cup of the warm mixed liquids, and put it in a blender with the minced garlic.  Puree until smooth.  Pour the garlic puree back into the stockpot with the other liquids.
3. Mix the white sugar, brown sugar, and citric acid into the pot and stir until dissolved.
4. Mix the entire 3Kg box of gochujang paste into the liquids in the pot.  It won't want to mix at first, so take your time, and just keep patiently mixing until all of it is evenly blended.
5. Mix in the sesame oil.
6. Put on the gloves and goggles.  Open the windows, especially the ones that the air tends to blow _out_ of, not the ones that the wind blows _in_ through.
7. Cut open the habaneros.  Remove and discard the stems and the seeds.
8. Put the habaneros in the blender with 1 cup of water.  Put the lid firmly and completely on the blender, and puree the habaneros in the water until very smooth.  Stop the blender, and let the puree settle for a moment.  Open the blender lid near the window with the outward ventilation.
9. Add about 1/4 of the habanero puree into the big pot with the gochujang, and mix thouroughly.  Taste for heat level, and continue adding habanero puree and mixing well until you get to a nice bright zingy heat!
10. Protip: clean the cutting board and knife that you used on the habaneros, and the blender, while you still have the gloves and goggles on, and the window open.  After doing this cleanup, then you can take off the protective gear.
11. Ladle the hot sauce into squeeze bottles (using the funnel) or other containers.

Refrigeration optional, but not needed.  

If you want to give people a little taste of the sauce, cut a banana into coin-shaped slices and put a drop of sauce on each one.
